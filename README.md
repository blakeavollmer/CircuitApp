# CircuitApp

# Installation
Under App --> UWP is a .sln file. With your Microsoft Hololens connected via USB, open the .sln file in visual studio. 
Set to Master and x86 at the top of the window.
In the dropdown where the green arrow is, select device and run the .sln file.

# Other options
If you do not have access to a Microsoft Hololens, import the project into Unity3D.
The HoloToolkit is included and should have a working emulator that you can use to test the app.
